<h2>Welcome to Simple Secure Messenger</h2>

<p>Why: Our privacy is being compromised. Hackers, governments, corporate espionage, there are many entities that want to see our conversations. There are two components at stake when privacy of communication is interfered: 1.Contents of the information exchanged. 2.The fact the exchange has happened. SSM solves both issues.</p>
<p>How: * Each and every message can be viewed by any user. Which increases privacy of (2) exchange of information
* Contents of a message stays private, through PGP encryption. Only the person who has the private PGP key can decode the message.
* Anyone can replicate the platform, with it's entire database of messages. This increases resiliance, compared to centralised services like email. The concept is inspired by the design of blockchain.</p>
<p>What: The platform is extremely simple in it's design. It can be run on any PHP server with MySQL database. Anyone with minimum programming knowledge is able to set it up in minutes.</p>
